# Transposition Cipher


## Aim

The aim is to create a python code to decrypt or encrpt text using transposition cipher

## Short description of project

The code takes in input string that needs to be encrypted and uses transpositional cipher to encrypt it similarly the reverse is applied for decryption.

## Required libraries

math

## Compilation Steps
Run the script, after that :

 1. User is prompted to enter key (integer)
 2. User is again prompted to enter the string/message to be encrypted or decrypted
 3. The program tells encrypts or decrypts the string



# Output
